# 🎶 Instructions for Vibers

You are the **Vibe Coding Team**.  
Your mission is to **build the app by talking directly to AI (Gemini, Copilot, or another tool)**.  
No specs, no upfront planning → just vibes ✨

---

## 📝 Rules

- You **cannot** write code manually.  
- All code must come from AI tools:
  - Ask Gemini or Copilot to generate, refactor, or fix code.  
  - Copy/paste results into your editor.  
- You may tweak prompts as much as you like, but you must stay inside the “vibe coding” style (no spec-first).

## 💡 Suggested Prompts

Start with something like:

I want to build a small web app using [React/Vue/Svelte].
The app should have the following features:

[List your app’s features here].
Please scaffold the project and give me the initial files.


Other useful follow-ups:

- “Can you add localStorage so data is not lost on refresh?”  
- “Make the UI more friendly: add a color palette and some styling.”  
- “Show me how to filter items in the list.”  

---

## 🎯 Deliverables

By the end of the workshop, your app should:

- Implement the required features (see [README.md](./README.md)).  
- Have a friendly UI (not just plain HTML).  
- Persist data with `localStorage`.  

And most importantly → be ready to compare your process vs the Specifiers team.
